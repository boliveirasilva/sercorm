# SercORM
###### A simple ORM for php5.6 implemented over ADOdb library
___

_**IMPORTANT NOTICE:** Feel free to suggest improvements or corrections, but I need to 
let you know that I'm making this library to solve a specific problem for a customer. 
It is not my intention to support or even continue to maintain it after project 
completion._

This library is being built to work with PHP5.6 in an environment that can vary between 
firebird, oracle and postgre databases. Due to internal issues, it was decided that 
this library should be built on top of ADOdb instead of using PDO directly.

### Testing the Library

**docker-compose.yml:** this file allows you to create a web-server docker containered 
with all the necessary resources for the development of this project.
